# Note to Learning Facilitator
This bot was developed in GitHub Codespaces as per project requirements. 
The bot is deployed and to ensure it is live while you are testing out, 
i have deployed it to run live 24/7 on Daki (https://daki.cc), 
a free Discord bot hosting platform. The code remains identical to 
the version in this repository. The .env file containing secrets is 
gitignored and not pushed to GitHub. Please message in the Discord server to test it.
